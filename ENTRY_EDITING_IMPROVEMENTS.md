# Entry Editing Improvements & Fixes

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issues Addressed**

### 1. âœ… **Frontend Cache Issue**
**Problem**: User edits were not updating on the frontend even though they were saving to the database.

**Solution**: 
- Added cache-busting timestamps to all entry update requests
- Implemented forced reload of sheet data after saves
- Added `_timestamp: Date.now()` to all update payloads

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/frontend/src/components/TeamSheets/TeamSheetEditor.js`
- `frontend/src/components/TeamSheets/TeamSheetEditor.js`

### 2. âœ… **Team Isolation**
**Problem**: Users could potentially edit entries from other teams.

**Solution**: 
- Added team validation in backend entry update route
- Only admins or users from the correct team can update entries
- Checks `team_sheets` table for team assignment validation

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/routes/sheetEntries.js`

### 3. âœ… **Conditional Field Display - Deployed in KE**
**Problem**: When "Deployed in KE?" is "No", other fields should not be applicable.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented automatic field clearing when "No" is selected
- All related fields set to "N/A" or empty when not deployed
- Site field only appears when "Yes" is selected

**Behavior**: 
- **"No"** â†’ All fields become "N/A"
- **"Yes"** â†’ Site field appears and other fields become editable

### 4. âœ… **Conditional Date Field - Vendor Contacted**
**Problem**: Date field should only appear when vendor contacted is "Yes".

**Solution**: 
- Vendor contact date field only shows when "Vendor Contacted" = "Yes"
- Automatically clears date when changing to "No"

**Behavior**:
- **"No"** â†’ Date field hidden/cleared
- **"Yes"** â†’ Date field appears

### 5. âœ… **Patching Two Date Columns**
**Problem**: Patching needed separate Est. Release Date and Implementation Date fields.

**Solution**: 
- Added dropdown for Patching (Yes/No/N/A)
- Two side-by-side date fields appear when "Yes" is selected:
  - **Est. Release Date**
  - **Implementation Date**
- Both fields cleared when changing to "No" or "N/A"

**Behavior**:
- **"No"/"N/A"** â†’ No date fields shown
- **"Yes"** â†’ Both date fields appear side by side

### 6. âœ… **Conditional Est. Time - Compensatory Controls**
**Problem**: Est. Time should only appear when compensatory controls provided is "Yes".

**Solution**: 
- Est. Time field only shows when "Compensatory Controls Provided" = "Yes"
- Automatically clears estimated time when changing to "No"

**Behavior**:
- **"No"** â†’ Est. Time field hidden/cleared
- **"Yes"** â†’ Est. Time field appears along with details field

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### Frontend Changes

#### Auto-Save with Cache Busting:
```javascript
const entryDataWithTimestamp = {
  ...responseData,
  _timestamp: Date.now() // Prevents browser caching
};
await sheetService.updateEntry(entryId, entryDataWithTimestamp);

// Force reload to show changes
setTimeout(() => {
  loadSheetData();
}, 1000);
```

#### Conditional Field Logic:
```javascript
// Clear related fields when parent field changes
if (field === 'deployed_in_ke' && value === 'N') {
  newResponses[entryId].site = 'N/A';
  newResponses[entryId].current_status = 'N/A';
  newResponses[entryId].vendor_contacted = 'N/A';
  // ... clear all other fields
}

if (field === 'vendor_contacted' && value !== 'Y') {
  newResponses[entryId].vendor_contact_date = '';
}

if (field === 'compensatory_controls_provided' && value !== 'Y') {
  newResponses[entryId].compensatory_controls_details = '';
  newResponses[entryId].estimated_time = '';
}

if (field === 'patching' && (value === 'N' || value === 'N/A')) {
  newResponses[entryId].patching_est_release_date = '';
  newResponses[entryId].implementation_date = '';
}
```

### Backend Changes

#### Team Isolation:
```javascript
// Check team assignment before allowing updates
if (req.user.role !== 'admin') {
  const teamAssignment = await db('team_sheets')
    .where('sheet_id', existingEntry.sheet_id)
    .where('team_id', req.user.team_id)
    .first();
  
  if (!teamAssignment) {
    return res.status(403).json({ 
      message: 'Access denied. This entry is not assigned to your team.' 
    });
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ **User Interface Updates**

### Form Guidelines Updated:
- Clear instructions about conditional field behavior
- Explains when fields appear/disappear
- Guides users on proper form completion

### Visual Improvements:
- Two-column layout for patching dates with labels
- Consistent conditional field hiding/showing
- Proper field grouping and spacing

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Recommendations**

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Cache Busting**:
   - Edit an entry â†’ Save â†’ Verify changes appear immediately
   - Test with multiple browser tabs open

2. **Team Isolation**:
   - User from Team A tries to edit Team B entry â†’ Should get 403 error
   - Admin can edit any team's entries
   - User can only edit their own team's entries

3. **Conditional Fields**:
   - Set "Deployed in KE" to "No" â†’ All fields should become "N/A"
   - Set "Deployed in KE" to "Yes" â†’ Site field should appear
   - Set "Vendor Contacted" to "No" â†’ Date field should disappear
   - Set "Vendor Contacted" to "Yes" â†’ Date field should appear
   - Set "Patching" to "Yes" â†’ Both date fields should appear
   - Set "Patching" to "No" â†’ Date fields should disappear
   - Set "Compensatory Controls" to "No" â†’ Est. Time should disappear
   - Set "Compensatory Controls" to "Yes" â†’ Est. Time should appear

## ðŸš€ **Components Updated**

### Frontend Components:
- `TeamSheetEditor.js` (both versions in different directories)
- `SheetEditorWithLocking.js`

### Backend Routes:
- `routes/sheetEntries.js` - Added team isolation

### Services:
- Entry update logic maintains existing functionality while adding validation

## ðŸŽ‰ **Result**

âœ… **Users can now edit entries with real-time updates**  
âœ… **Entries are isolated by team for security**  
âœ… **Conditional fields appear/disappear based on selections**  
âœ… **Patching has proper two-date structure**  
âœ… **All field dependencies work correctly**  

The system now provides a smooth, secure, and intuitive entry editing experience with proper data isolation and conditional field behavior.
